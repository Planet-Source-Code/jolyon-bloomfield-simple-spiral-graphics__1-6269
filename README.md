## Simple Spiral Graphics


</div>

### Description

This code is all in a simple module, making it fairly easy to draw a spiral at run time. I have commented most lines, but anybody with some understanding of trigonometry should be able to get it. Uses about 9 different input parameters to totally customize your program. I have tested this with VB 6 and 5, so no guarantees for the lower ones, but it should work 'coz all it is is maths. I have also included a nice testing app to show what types of spiral are possible ;) Please vote. Thanks!
